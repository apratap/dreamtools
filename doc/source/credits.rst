Credits
----------

Contributions to **DreamTools** are direct (e.g. by contributing to the code in  the github repository github.com.dreamtools) or indirectly (e.g., by developing an original scoring functions in DREAM challenges). Since **DreamTools** framework is dynamic by nature, we won't keep a list of contributors here but one should look at each scoring module (e.g., dreamtools/dream5/D5C2/scoring.py). This will then be parsed automatically to generate on-line documentation.
